This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Replace this README file with notes on your implementation.
Mentions any special features or limitations.

Questions:

1. How to allocate and reallocate memory for command_stream object
	reallocation is probably done in parsing
2. Subshell: parsing handle subshell instead? Tree will handle only || && |
